          Hello, I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside as a first-year student. I would say that I have a lot of
          effective skills that are beneficial. To start with, I am a bilingual speaker who speaks both Arabic and English. I make sure to use my communication skills to be able to communicate
          effectively with my peers and instructors. I am collaborative, interpersonal, problem solver, organized, reliable, trustworthy, and dependable.
          I am familiar with all different platforms such as Google and Microsoft and know how to use them properly. At UCR, I am currently majoring in Sociology. After completing all the necessary requirements such as my degree
          and my teaching credential I will then become an elementary school teacher. The coursework that I have participated
          in during my high school years has furthered my knowledge and skills in becoming a teacher and has given me the experience and the opportunity to grow a
          passion for teaching. These classes have allowed me to grow these new skills through the several experiences I have gone through and the several responsibilities that comes with being an elementary school teacher. I hope to gain more experience and knowledge as I start my journey to becoming a teacher and completing all my requirements.<br><br>

          Throughout my high school years, I completed many classes through
          the North Orange County Regional Occupational Program that was hosted at my high school. This program allowed me to experience real-life experience working with children at the nearby elementary school children.
          At first, I had taken a Child Development course. We first had to learn the basics of how the child's brain works before we got the opportunity to join work-based learning. I had learned about their cognitive abilities, social interaction, emotional regulation, speech, language, physical skills, and sensory awareness. During my course year in Child Development, I also joined
          a club where I quickly became a Secretary. I had the opportunity to go to Salk Elementary to perform fun learning activities for the
          children to participate in. I became really interested in working with children at that moment. I enjoyed being a positive figure.
          I loved being able to help the students learn a concept and to celebrate with them their successes and learning progress. Over time,
          being heavily involved in the club and the classroom I had completed over 50 hours of community service by working with the children there.<br><br>

          After the completion of Child Development, I took it upon myself to continue the education pathway and to enroll in Teaching
          Students with Special Needs where I got the opportunity to lesson plan and teach students with special needs. During that experience, I learned
          a lot about myself. I also learned how to be patient and understanding. The last education pathway course I took was Principles of Teaching. While being in my
          community classroom I have learned how to communicate clearly and effectively with great reason. Working with children has taught me how
          to communicate effectively in a way that creates a safe learning environment.
